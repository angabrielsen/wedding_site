Joseph and Ashton met in college through McNeese State University's Speech & Debate team. Although, Joseph was a few years younger his smart and wits were why Ashton chose him as a sometimes debate partner and a long-term friend. Joseph makes amazing white chicken chili, anything baked, and can also tell you more than you'd ever need to know about folklore and fairytales!

Currently bogged down while working on his PhD, Joseph still has the time to dedicate to being one of Ashton's best friends and giving great advice. In nearly ten years of friendship, Joseph and Ashton have traveled all over the country with the debate team, kept incredibly busy with school, work, and life, and maintained a fantastic friendship.
