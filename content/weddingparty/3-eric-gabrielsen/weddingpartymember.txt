Eric managed to beat James out of the womb by a couple years, but is nice enough to not rub it in. Despite Eric living in Texas with his wife Leesa and their two certifiably-the-cutest-ever daughters, James and Eric keep close by cooperatively killing zombies and monsters across the internet, and by James's attempts to get Eric to follow Major League Soccer by one-sidedly trash talking everytime Real Salt Lake plays FC Dallas.

James and Ashton got to make an impromptu visit to their home when they got stuck in the Dallas airport due to weather delays, and have been hoping for more weather delays every time they fly through. James is glad to have a reason to get the old gang back together.
