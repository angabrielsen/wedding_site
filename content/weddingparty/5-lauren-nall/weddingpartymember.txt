A love of all things Harry Potter and musical helped cement Ashton and Lauren's friendship after meeting atop a hill at Red Butte Gardens while attending The Avett Brothers concert. Since then their friendship has been a whirlwind of Strawberry Hill Boone's Farm, backyard fires, and binge watching Downton Abbey.

Ashton loves how the creativity and passion she pours into working with her high school English students also enhances their friendship. She goes above and beyond for her kids and her friends by working as the school's debate coach, as well as making the best strawberry margaritas. Don't worry, the margaritas are strictly for friends.
