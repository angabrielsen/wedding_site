Role: maidofhonor

Text: 

Milli and Ashton bonded in college over their mutual love of English lit and need for a study buddy. Over the last eight years Milli and Ashton have endured multi-day Harry Potter movie marathons, late night cram sessions (mostly where Ashton begged to see Milli's French homework), and built an incredible friendship.

Milli's ability to multi-task like no other and to be ever present with great advice is why Milli makes an excellent teacher and why she's Ashton's Maid of Honor. In addition to supporting Ashton on her big day, Milli is also prepping for her December  2016 wedding to her fianc√© Jamie. They currently reside in Lake Charles with their two adorable pup-babies Roux and Ashlyn.
