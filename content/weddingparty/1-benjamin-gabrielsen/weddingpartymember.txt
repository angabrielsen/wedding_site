When James was nearly eight, Ben was born as their parents made one last-ditch effort to have a girl. Twenty-six years later, he continues to disappoint and frustrate their parents. Nevertheless, he has been a continual support, confidant, and friend to James through each other's highs and lows.

Ben is a guitarist of face-melting talent, and is passing this gift on to the next generation as a guitar instructor while he supports his wife Julia through school. He is planning on attending music production school so that he may better bless the world with the gift of Metal. Ben and Julia live in Ogden with the fur-babies Satine, Judas, and Daisy.
