LillyAnne has helped Ashton feel like she was back home in Louisiana from the first day they met! Every girl needs a great drinking buddy, shopping pal, and fellow hair and makeup fanatic. Ashton and Lilly can usually be found at Poplar Street Pub discussing the meaning of life over microbrews and Grape Mind Erasers.

Ashton can't wait to have Lilly's mastery of all things hair, makeup, and professional drink slinging available on her big day, and the other bridesmaids will be just as lucky to have her. Easily identifiable by her bombshell, red lipstick, every girl is lucky to have a friend like Lilly and Ashton is no exception.
