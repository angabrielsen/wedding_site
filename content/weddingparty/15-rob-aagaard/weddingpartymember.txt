When Ashton first introduced James to Rob at Rob and Nikol's wedding reception, James was always impressed and appreciative of Rob's generosity of friendship; James never felt like he was just "Ashton's boyfriend." When the two worked together briefly, Rob frequently provided James with advice and direction that still serve him to this day.

In the years since, they have bonded over the enjoyment of video games, appreciation of good whiskey (James owes Rob everything he knows on the subject), and craft beer, and James hopes to one day match Rob's brewing skills (and kegerator setup).
