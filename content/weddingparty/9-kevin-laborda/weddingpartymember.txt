James met Kevin while singing karaoke at a Bar Named Sue as part of a social life Meetup Group; it was literally the first time James had ever heard Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit" outside of a drug sequence in a movie. While impressed with Kevin's classic rock song selection, James and Kevin bonded over nerdier interests, ranging from tabletop gaming to spirituality to the insatiable need to dance when a song with a good beat comes on.

Kevin has always been generous with support and advice when needed, and alternates in the role of keeping people grounded and bringing the party. James is sure this is one party that would be incomplete without him.
