A long time ago, in a hot tub far, far away, Derek and Ashton met in hot tub in Colorado while attending the same debate tournament. A continued friendship sent them on an epic journey to their first Bonnaroo together in the summer of 2010. That summer cemented their continuing long-distance friendship with Ashton making many visits to Utah.

Derek introduced Ashton to some amazing friends in Salt Lake City, the opportunity to snowboard, and a love for Utah mountains. With that kind of motivation, how could she not move to Salt Lake? Although, he moved away to new adventures in San Franscisco, Ashton credits Derek for her cross country move and ultimately with meeting the love of her life, James.
