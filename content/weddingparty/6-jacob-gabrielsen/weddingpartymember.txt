There was once a time when people mistook Jake and James for twins, but personally I never saw it. They can easily be told apart because thought Jake is taller, James is much more physically imposing. Despite being separated by five years in birth order,  Jake and James have managed to keep close through a mutual love of The Simpsons, the Utah Jazz, violent video games, and passionate (though diametrically opposed) political opinions.

Jake is a physical therapist in Meridian, Idaho. He lives there with his wife LaNae and their ever-growing gaggle of  (choose your adjective: adorable, bright, precocious, diabolical) kids.
