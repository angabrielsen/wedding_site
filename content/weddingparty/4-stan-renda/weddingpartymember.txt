If not for a fortuitous double rainbow above the Red Butte Gardens Amphitheater, Stan and James may never have met. Since then, they've built a friendship around musical nerdery, backyard campfires, deep conversations, lazy weekends hanging around at each other's houses, as well as James attempting to occasionally explain to the native Alabaman the finer points of Utah history. 

The "musical nerdery" bit is no joke, either, as he teaches his students his own love of music in his role as a high school band director, and keeps his own skills sharp by rocking out on his tuba. He also makes a mean dirty martini. Seriously. The dirtiest.
