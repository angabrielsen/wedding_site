Nikol and Ashton met when Ashton was first visiting Salt Lake and contemplating a cross-country move. Since she made the move Nikol has always been there to share a great homebrew, an infectious laugh, or delicious creme brulee French toast.

Nikol has a welcoming smile, a contagious laugh and the best whiskey recommendations, so if you see her or her husband Rob, be sure to ask! Nikol also has a fantastic eye for art and enjoys working with pottery and painting in her spare time. After years of being welcome in Nikol's home for video games and hanging out with her super chill pups, Sam and Max, Ashton's excited to return the hospitality in her home state.
