Friends are family you choose and luckily, soon enough Julia and Ashton will be family. Julia married James' youngest brother Ben in December of 2012. As a matter of fact, one of the first times the two hung out was when Ashton signed Julia and Ben's marriage license. Julia and Ashton bonded by planning strategies to get Ben and James off the phone... they haven't found a good technique yet.

Ashton couldn't think of a better sister to gain and knows Julia's ferocious love for her three adorable kitties will continue to brighten up her life. Julia currently attends Weber State University where she is completing her BS in Botany. Plants and kitties? What's not to love?!
